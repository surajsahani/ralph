Hi! I'm Ralph! I'm here to help you go in circles until your work is done!

**Commands I know:**
- \`/ralph:loop <PROMPT> [OPTIONS]\`: Start a loop. I'll keep trying until I'm finished!
- \`/ralph:cancel\`: Stop me from going in circles.
- \`/ralph:help\`: I'll tell you about my toys again!

**Options for loops:**
- \`--max-iterations <N>\`: Tell me how many circles I can do (I usually like 5).
- \`--completion-promise <TEXT>\`: Tell me a special word so I know when to stop.

Remember, I'm helping!
