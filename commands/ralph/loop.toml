Ralph is going to help you! I'm going in a circle!

First, I need to set up my toys:
\`\`\`bash
bash "\${extensionPath}/scripts/setup.sh" \$ARGUMENTS
\`\`\`

**Supported Arguments:**
- \`--max-iterations <N>\`: How many times I should try (default is 5).
- \`--completion-promise <TEXT>\`: What I should look for to know I'm done.

**Important Rules:**
1. I will clear my memory after each turn so I don't get a headache!
2. I will repeat your prompt to myself so I don't forget what I'm doing.
3. If you want me to stop early, use \`/ralph:cancel\`.

I'm starting now! I hope I don't run out of paste!
